# Compiler-Parser

### Exercise 1
Give	a	simple	interface	(API),	for	a	symbol	table	adapted	to	this	calculator.
Example:	is_variable_defined:	return	true	if	the	variable	has	been	initialized.

### Exercise 2
Write	a	parser	analyzing	the	function	declaration	and	displaying:

Function:	foo <br />
Type:	int <br />
Arguments:	a	(int),	b	(string) <br />

In	the	case	of	a	second	declaration	of	the	same	function,	we	want	to check	the	coherency	of	the	declaration	and	display	error	messages	if	the	function has the	same	name	and	different	arguments.
